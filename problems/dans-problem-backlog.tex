Timmy walks out of his house and starts repeatedly turning left. Under what conditions does he return to his starting location?
Timmy walks out of his house and down the road. He starts repeatedly taking the first left. Given that he can always take another left prove that he must return to his initial position

A particle is thrown from point A at angle $\theta$ from the ground with initial velocity $u$ metres per second. At the same instant the ball is thrown a pole with base $B $d$ metres from $A$ and with length $L$ is knocked so as to give it a angular velocity $\omega$. Given that the particle collides with the end of the pole. What is $\omega$ in terms of $u$, $L$, $d$ and $\theta$?

In the board game risk player 1 launches a attack from a territory with x units against a territory with y units. Assuming player 1 doesn’t give up their assault. For what x and y can we expect player 1 to capture the territory?

Rich’s game n = 3
There are T pots each containing some number of stones. Two players take turns removing 1, 2 or 3 stones from a pot of their choice. The player who takes the last stone from the last pot wins. Given that for any initial configuration one of the players has a forced win. Produce a strategy such that the player with the winning position can always force a win

A particle like chicken is launched horizontally from a height h with initial velocity v. The chicken bounces in such a way such that it’s vertical velocity after bouncing is ur where u is the velocity before bouncing and r is a constant such that 0<r<1. How far does the chicken travel horizontally?

Jar Deduction
There are three jars. One with red fruit, one with blue fruit and one with red and blue fruit. You can’t see inside the jars. Ammar has mischievously relabelled the jars, but foolishly he tells you that each label is on the wrong jar. Provide a strategy such that you can correctly relabel the jars by checking a random fruit from a jar of your choice

Square in circle with identical angles problem

A particle is launched from a height h at a angle of Theta, with an initial velocity of u. Given that it lands at Pi/4 degrees to the horizontal, what was its initial Theta.

A empty cone with height H and radius R is filled with water such that the
 Rate of change of volume filled with respect to time is F. Find the rate of change of the surface area of the water with respect to time. The cone is now tilted so as to be at a angle of Theta. What is the rate of change of the surface area of the water with respect to time?
